After  opening with a flat note, the market has slipped into weakness in the early part of the session.  The buying has emerged from the day’s low of 19491 levels and the upside recovery got  strengthened towards the later part of the session and Nifty closed near the highs. A small positive candle was formed on the daily chart with minor upper and long lower shadow.  Technically, this pattern reflects high volatility in the market. Post the upside breakout of  crucial resistance of the down sloping trend line at 19,450 levels recently, the Nifty manages to  move up consistently with the formation of lower shadows in the last three sessions candles.  The upside breakout of trend line resistance remains intact. The short-term trend of Nifty continues to be positive. One may expect further upside in the  coming sessions. Any dips down to the immediate support of 19,500 is likely to be a buy on dips opportunity. The next upside levels to be watched are around 19,800-19,900 for the near term. Buying can be initiated in Hikal at CMP (Rs 313), add more on dips down to Rs 303, wait for  the upside targets of Rs 344 and Rs 375 in the next 3-5 weeks. Place a stoploss of Rs 289.

"Updated: September 7, 2023 13:46 IST","Midcaps at lifetime highs, smallcap stocks outperform broader markets; can this performance sustain?","The Nifty Midcap index has been on an impressive run, recently crossing the psychological milestone of 40,000 points. Nifty Midcap 100 hit a fresh record high today at 40,540.95. Over the last six months, it witnessed a remarkable surge of approximately 35%, demonstrating its resilience in a market marked by volatility, while the smallcap index soars above the 12,000 mark to capture around 40% gain since March 2023. Arvinder Singh Nanda, Senior Vice President at Master Capital Services, attributed this impressive performance to several factors. One significant driver was the growing risk appetite among investors, driven by improving economic health and domestic developments. Midcap stocks were often seen as closely tied to economic growth, offering the potential for lucrative returns. As such, they had become a favored choice for investors seeking to capitalize on India’s economic resurgence.Liquidity also played a pivotal role in bolstering investor confidence in midcap stocks. The increased liquidity in these stocks attracted more investors, further fueling the rally. However, Ajit Mishra, SVP of Technical Research at Religare Broking, issued a caution, saying that there are overbought indications in the midcap space. This suggested that while the midcap rally was impressive, prudent stock selection was crucial in navigating the then-current market conditions.In tandem with the midcap rally, the Nifty Smallcap index had been on an equally impressive trajectory. It had soared past the 12,000 mark, registering gains of approximately 40% since March 2023. This extraordinary ascent had positioned smallcap stocks as a hotbed of opportunity for investors.Some market experts argued that India’s market dynamics had shifted towards being more stock to sector-oriented. They anticipated that, in the medium to long term, the small and midcap categories as a whole would continue to outperform. While these segments had exhibited robust short-term performance, sustaining this momentum had presented challenges.",Zoya Springwala,FINANCIAL EXPRESS

Among Sectors, the Media index was the top gainer, rallying over 3% whereas intraday profit booking was seen in banking and selective Auto stocks. Technically, after a sharp reversal, the index is comfortably trading above 50 and 20-day SMA (Simple Moving Average), and on intraday charts it has consistently formed a higher bottom formation, which is largely positive. For the trend-following traders now, 19,500 would be the sacrosanct support zone. Above the same, the index could move up to 19,620-19,650. On the flip side, below 19,500 bulls may prefer to exit from the trading long positions. Below 19,500 the index could slip to 19,450-19,420.For the last few sessions, the counter was stuck in a range-bound movement and presently we witnessed a range breakout on a daily scale. Moreover, the closing above its resistance zone along with decent volume activity suggests that the counter has good potential for further upside in the near future.The stock has underperformed in the past few weeks and it has witnessed a downtrend. After the sharp correction from higher levels, the stock is currently trading in a range-bound mode, which indicates for accumulation at these levels. Therefore, upward movement from the current level is expected to resume in the coming sessions.The stock witnessed a gradual decline from the higher levels in the past few sessions. However, the downside seems to be restricted due to the multiple support zone. Recent reversal formation with decent volume activity indicates the counter is further gaining bullish traction. Hence, we expect the uptrend to resume from the current levels.The stock has shown a remarkable rally from the lows recently, and the trend of the stock is still in the rising direction.

"September 5, 2023 12:12 IST","Markets undergoing correction for past month, select heavyweights outperform; US markets to drive global cues","By Ajit MishraMarkets have been maintaining a corrective tone for over one and a half months now. However, buying in select heavyweights combined with noticeable outperformance of the broader indices is not only capping the pace of decline but also offering regular buying opportunities. Amid all, mixed signals from the global front are keeping the participants guessing over the next directional move. In short, we are seeing more time wise corrections in the benchmark index, after a phenomenal surge. Going ahead, the performance of the global markets, especially the US, will remain on the radar for cues, in the absence of any major domestic event. Though we have witnessed a decent rebound in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) in the past week, we need a decisive close above 35,300 in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) for any meaningful recovery. In case of a decline, it should hold the 33800-34250 zone. While the benchmark is not offering any clear signal over the next directional move, participants should stay focused on stock-specific opportunities based on the sectoral trend. Among the key indices, we suggest preferring auto, metal and IT for long trades while pharma and FMCG may continue to trade lackluster. Needless to say, the consistent outperformance of the midcap and smallcap is the highlight of the recent corrective phase but traders shouldn’t go overboard and stick only with the fundamentally sound counters, even for short term trading.Nifty has managed to hold 19,200 despite multiple attempts of breakdown in the last three weeks and that may help the bulls to reclaim the lost ground ahead. However, it would be early to say that the trend has reversed until we decisively cross and sustain 19,650 levels.The banking index has also been witnessing volatile swings while hovering within 43600-45000 for the last 3 weeks. We feel the prevailing mixed trend among the private banking majors would result in further consolidation ahead.

Demand is already there,” he said.Over half of India’s roughly 25 gigawatts (GW) of gas-fired power capacity is non-operational because of relatively high LNG prices. The share of gas-fired power in overall output has fallen from an average of over 3% in the last decade to less than 2% currently because of the high prices.Kumar told the conference that the LNG market is likely to remain “slightly soft” for the next two or three years.“And that gives us comfort. We believe that we will mostly be working through long-term contracts to the extent required for meeting seasonal demand. For unseasonal volatility in demand, we will manage through the market,” he said.India is seeking additional volumes of natural gas and has asked utilities to expedite completion of power plant maintenance as part of emergency steps to stop electricity outages, according to a government note dated Sept. 5 and reviewed by Reuters.",Reuters,FINANCIAL EXPRESS

Petrol rates and diesel rates have been steady over the last few months. However, individual cities see fluctuations in their prices every day. The prices of petrol and diesel change state by state, depending upon various criteria such as Value Added Tax (VAT), freight charges, local taxes, etc.The last country-wide change in fuel rates was on 21 May last year, when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman slashed excise duty on petrol by Rs 8 per litre and Rs 6 per litre on diesel.

Let us begin by discussing the market outlook itself because of late we have seen a solid momentum when it comes to midcap, smallcap indices, which are up 30% for the year already. Where do we go from here on? Do you see a bit of a frothiness coming into the midcap and smallcap space?
Frothiness, yes, First of all, the broad market does not look very stretched but at the same time, one figure we track very regularly is the ratio of BSE small cap/Nifty 50. Presently it is quoting at about 1.84 and if we look back then what we have noticed in previous occasions is that around 1.8 ratio, the level started going down in 2018.

Real frenzy happened in 2008 where it went up to 2.20. So that is one pointer which actually keeps us a bit cautious about the different pockets of mid and smallcaps. But the overall market looks pretty okay as of now because after 18 or 19 months of consolidation from 2021 the market has reached about 20,000 and then again come back from there.

There is every reason to believe that the market will cross this 20,000 barrier or at least reach up to that place, so sector rotation is important, caution is always important but more important are the areas where frenzies are being observed, mostly because of retail participation because the small caps generally are being brought over by the retail clients.

You are talking about Nifty reaching that 20,000-mark very soon but once we hit that, where do we go? Is it going to be the last time that we hit 20000 and retrace and consolidate or after perhaps 20,500 and higher levels are coming?
We have a view that over a period of time, there will be volatility going ahead because election is coming and a lot of news flows will come from non-market areas which may affect the market sentiment. But over a long period of time, Nifty will obviously go up but even in the shorter term, it can go to 21,000-22,000 levels. Once the market has consolidated over such a long period of time, this bull market would not stop very easily.

So after 20,000, there is a chance of touching 21,000-22,000 but for that to happen in a week, largecaps will need to participate as well. Right now the rally has been led by midcaps. Banking, especially the private banks have done nothing in the last three to four months. When do we see momentum coming back to HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank and others?
It is very difficult to say when the momentum will come back but we are looking into beaten down pockets. There are areas where I feel a sectoral rotation will take place because the stocks or the sectors which have gone one way will consolidate or come down depending on the quality of the company but at the same time the other stocks will come up because of liquidity. The liquidity for the market is adequate because domestic money is coming and also remember that FIIs have not really loosened their purse strings very much. So that money is also waiting in the wings. Now all we need to see is when the Fed rate starts coming down or when Fed actually pauses as that creates a big friction for FII money to come in. That will actually take the Nifty forward.

I think there was some readjustment going on HDFC Bank and HDFC merger and Reliance and these areas and that has kept the Nifty number a little bit low artificially. Once that hangover is gone, there will be an upward trend in Nifty. Overall, caution is expected or required in the small cap area but at the same time overall large market sentiment is uptrending.

Among private banks, is there a pecking order that you can talk to us about? Which stocks do you prefer the most? Secondly, what is your view on pharma because that too is coming back on investor radar?
Let us not discuss specific stocks but we feel that there are private banks where they have raised the capital or where they have got a very niche quality clientele based in the southern part of India.

Also, we are looking into the pharma sector but more into the API space where we feel that the capacity will be an important parameter going ahead if the China plus one policy takes root. These are low-hanging fruits of actually reducing the dependence on China or actually broadening the supply base beyond China. We are looking into the API capacities across the different verticals and we are pretty okay about the valuations right now.

Also we are looking into some domestic pharma because going ahead, domestic pharma and pharma related areas like the hospital supplies and areas will have a long runway ahead. If you look into the FDI investments in the hospital sector which is actually very high, we can do that play around the areas of hospital and medicine and pharma.

What is your view on IT because the Street is divided on it? One part says that it is reasonably priced but then the other believes that there is a reason for that reasonable pricing given that there are a lot of macro headwinds but do you think it has played out and it is time to look at it positively?
We are not as negative as the market on IT because the demand is structural on IT and also a lot of new technologies are coming in including AI that also requires IT support. And more digitization and change from many-many areas of legacy areas to the newer areas to the more industry 4.0 and all many other areas where the IT demand will be there.

The rupee is also a little weak and that will also give an immediate support to the downside of the IT stock. If you want to keep a portfolio some kind of a balance to the portfolio, it is a good area to put some money, specifically if the companies which are in midcap IT space are companies where prices may have doubled, tripled, but there is some space still there. A disclosure, we do not have a very major IT allocation in our portfolios as on date but we are looking into it. We have IT only in very large portfolios.",,Economic Times

Since you do not hug the index in terms of the portfolio you manage, at the current juncture, where are you picking your spots? Are you riding the momentum or is it time to exercise some caution, think a little bit contra and start raising cash?
I would say that it is exactly the way you put it. You have to be the most cautious in the smallest names because there the execution challenges are going to be pretty high, especially for companies with less than Rs 100-200-300 crore of profit and if valuations are at a point where you are expecting flawless execution for many years. I would be the most cautious in the smallest name and then less as you go higher up the curve.

Your current portfolio shows you are bullish on telecom and that includes Tata Communication. Technically it is an IT company. You are bullish on the media and pharma stocks. But I do not see too many banks in your portfolio. Is there a conscious strategy that you were shying away from banks?
No, I think banks will do well. We have nothing against the banks. We always ask this question. It is more a question of whether there are opportunities elsewhere which may be more interesting. Structurally, banks struggle getting past 17-18% ROEs even in the best of the times in terms of cycles and from an investment cycle perspective, we are in a sweet spot in terms of the economy. There are other better opportunities. I am sure banks will also do well.

22% of your total portfolio is healthcare but that is a serious contra move because you are way above the benchmark and this is one sector which has both good and bad. Post Covid, it got re-rated, then de-rated and it has elements of volatility, USFDA. This is a complicated sector.
Yes, it is a complicated sector in many ways, but it is also a very simple sector in many ways. We are looking at pharma and healthcare, more from a domestic standpoint, not so much from an offshore standpoint. Of course, most larger companies have exposure offshore. But it is the domestic which makes us most bullish.

We think that overall domestic healthcare will continue to grow as you will continue to see consolidation and the top players will continue to gain market share, at least the good quality ones and it is a very long-term structural growth story. We maybe at the beginning of it. The biggest change we have seen in pharma is capital allocation.

Capital allocation for larger businesses have become much better over the years, especially over the last three to four years and that is starting to show up in the health of their balance sheets. So, as their balance sheets become healthier, their ability to capture the domestic growth continues to go up exponentially and that to us is the most interesting part in the healthcare space.

The last time we interacted with you, you were talking about how you have added weight within the auto component segment. A) Does that investment still hold? And B) have you diversified into the main play autos as well?
We have always held a large auto company, even for the last four years now. On the auto component side, we continue to add weight. We stopped in the previous quarter as the prices went up. But yes, those companies that we bought into, we still continue to hold.

Media is one of your preferred sectors as well. What is the rationale behind it at a time when ad rates are shrinking across segments?
We have seen a significant consolidation in the media business. Typically all global players are getting aligned in the domestic space. Top three players with the consolidation that we have seen will control significant viewership shares. This is, to me, a beginning of the point where you will not see very cheap ad rates.

What would be the outlook when it comes to the industrial sector given the kind of boost that we are seeing from the government and overall pickup, corporate sounding very confident? What is the sense that you're getting, is this going to be a long term play?
It is going to be a long term play, according to us. But, you just have to think about the valuations. One thing is structurally being right on the cycle but the other thing is what prices are you willing to pay for these companies. That is where we are getting a little stuck now.

Let us look at a few themes here; a) based on cyclicality, b), based on the big picture. When I say big picture, compounding, where for the next one, two, three years, PMS fund managers like to fish. Where do you think there is a case for re-rating and de-rating?
I do not know that. You only know with hindsight. But what I would say is that look at what is happening in industries. A lot of industries are going through consolidation where the top two, three, four players are continuing to gain market share significantly. And then there are industries which are going through significant fragmentation with many new large players entering these businesses because these businesses have been very profitable and high growth for many years.

I would say that you need to be careful where you are seeing more players and fragmentation of the market in many ways. Some people call some of it disruption, whatever word you want to use. Wherever you are seeing structural consolidation, is where over time there will be a higher rating.

Let us now build on that point, I will divide the entire scenario into pockets, one, two, three and five plus. If you are looking for themes, ideas – both in terms of market share gain, mean reversion or perhaps sunrise sectors, what would you identify in the one, two, three-year basket and what would you identify in the five-year plus basket?
Honestly, our ability to take more than a five year call is very limited. I would say that one, two, three, maybe slightly longer is what we can see right now because there are so many things that change globally that it is very difficult to kind of take a call beyond three years. At least that is what we humbly feel.

So from our perspective and that is what our portfolios reflect, a pharma or a telecom or for that matter, media and then, of course, bottom up ideas across the auto components, even in infrastructure companies like airports, ports, we see good opportunity that for at least next one to three years. These companies are very well poised and are also available at a reasonable price. For us, that is very important. You can have a very good play structurally but if you pay a wrong price for it, then on the longer term, it kind of becomes more challenging to justify.

Do you think there is merit in turning contra now in IT because there are a couple of sizable large deals with some of these IT majors have bagged? While margin improvement could be slow, revenue visibility definitely could see an uptick soon.
It is difficult for us to take a call right now. We are still seeing a little bit of a struggle in terms of revenue growth for at least the larger players. We do not know if it will change in one quarter or two quarters. But in terms of valuations, a lot of these companies do not look very expensive. We have to wait and see where and how big a turn that we see in the revenue growth rate because that to me is the key if you want to increase exposure there.",,Economic Times

""The domestic market initially opened with a lackluster performance, influenced by weak global cues. However, as the day progressed, a decline in US bond yields and crude oil prices injected some positivity into the market,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

""Interestingly, mid and smallcap stocks managed to retain investor interest even though their valuations are relatively high. Nonetheless, the persistently weak trade data from China continues to cast a shadow over the global market's outlook,"" Nair added.

Aditya Gaggar, Director of Progressive Shares, said, ""By forming a strong bullish candle on the daily chart, the index has breached its stiff resistance of 19,640 and extending the current up-move, the next resistance comes at 19,870 while support stands at 19,640.""

Global Markets
World stocks slid for a third straight day on Thursday and were choppy in Europe, as new signs of sustained inflationary pressures in the US and rising energy prices globally boosted the case for higher-for-longer interest rates.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng and an index of mainland Chinese blue chips each dropped around 1.3%. Australia's benchmark lost 1.2% while Japan's Nikkei fell 0.75%, which snapped an eight-session winning streak.

US stock futures pointed to a 0.2% decline after a 0.7% slide for the S&P 500 overnight.

Oil Falls
Oil prices eased on Thursday as worries over demand due to a seasonal slowdown during winter and an uncertain economic outlook for China outweighed expectations of tighter supplies from extended production cuts in Saudi Arabia and Russia.

Brent crude futures fell 41 cents to $90.19 a barrel, after a nine-session winning streak. US West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) futures fell 52 cents to $87.02 a barrel after seven sessions of gains.

Rupee Weakens
The Indian rupee weakened 0.10% versus the US dollar and was quoted at 83.21 per dollar, despite likely dollar-selling intervention from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as elevated US treasury yields and weakness in other Asian currencies weighed on the local unit.

Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Research (Retail), Kotak Securities
Nifty successfully cleared the short-term resistance of 19,650 and post breakout it intensified the positive momentum. Higher bottom formation on intraday charts and bullish candle on daily charts support further uptrend from the current levels. We are of the view that 19,650 would be the key level to watch out for, and above the same the index could move up to 19,800-19,825. On the flip side, below 19,650, the uptrend would be vulnerable.

"Sep 07, 2023, 09:29 AM IST",India’s $775 billion stock boom at risk as smallcaps overheat,"That poses risks as gauges of small and mid-cap shares show signs of overheating, and as the domestic economic outlook becomes more clouded ahead of national elections next year.The rally in Indian equities that has swelled the market’s total valuation by $775 billion in a little more than five months has been accompanied by a notable shift in investor preference to smaller stocks.

That poses risks as gauges of small and mid-cap shares show signs of overheating, and as the domestic economic outlook becomes more clouded ahead of national elections next year.

Smaller companies are seen benefiting more from the ongoing recovery in India’s capital expenditure. Larger stocks, in contrast, have been relatively restrained by worry over the impact of a possible global recession on the nation’s major IT firms, as well as fallout from a short-seller campaign against the sprawling group controlled by billionaire Gautam Adani.

The trend is the opposite to what has been seen in the US stock market, which has been driven by a handful of technology megacaps surging on the boom in artificial intelligence, leaving small caps in the dust.

The Nifty Midcap 100 Index has risen 37% from a March low, compared with a 16% gain in the blue-chip NSE Nifty 50 Index, driving the ratio of the former to the latter to an all-time high. The previous such peak in early 2018 was followed by a drop of about 25% in the midcap gauge over the next nine months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Bloomberg

Investors are still looking to bet on one of the world’s fastest growing economies, driving the Southeast Asian nation’s equity benchmarks to a series of record highs over the past two decades. And the shift in leadership away from the biggest names has been fueled by a flood of funds from retail investors, indicating broader participation in the market.

Still, the pace of gains in smaller stocks relative to large caps has raised caution about the near-term outlook for the latest uptrend in Indian stocks.
“The outperformance is definitely getting into an extreme territory,” said Sanjay Mookim, India strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Midcaps have advanced even as earnings estimates stagnate, so “there is a natural limit” to how much further they can climb, added Mookim, who projects the Nifty 50 will close 2023 down 5%.

Technical indicators also suggest the rally is poised for some consolidation. Momentum for the Nifty Smallcap 100 Index, which has jumped 46% from its March trough, has surged to its highest level in nine years. The gauge’s 14-week relative strength index has risen to around 86, above the level of 70 typically seen as representing overbought levels.

The brokerage recommends a buy-on-dips strategy.

The December Silver futures were trading at Rs 72,155 per kg on the MCX on Thursday in afternoon trade and were down by Rs 317 or 0.44% from Wednesday's closing price. Silver futures have fallen 4.24% or Rs 3,210 in September so far.

The domestic brokerage has put a first target at Rs 82,000 while it sees immediate support at Rs 70,500 while a strong medium-term support at Rs 68,000.

After 11% gains in the first four months of 2023, silver witnessed some turbulence at higher levels, the brokerage said, while noting that domestic silver prices have seen a range shift on the higher side after every major dip. ""We expect this trend to continue,"" the note said.

It lists five triggers that could engineer a rally in silver prices:

1) Demand from the industrial side is expected to rise significantly, hence apart from advancement in green technology global growth-related data points could also play an important role in the medium term.

2) Fed raised US growth forecast for 2023, suggesting soft landing, supportive for industrial metals and silver. Solar energy, EVs, 5G tech are likely to drive the demand for silver.

3) Festive season demand on the domestic front could also positively impact prices.

4) Though recession fears have subsided, any rise in uncertainty with respect to growth could increase the safe-haven bet for gold, which could be supportive for silver as well.

5) Silver is blessed with a dual advantage of being influenced by fundamentals of industrial and precious metals supporting it at timely intervals.

Groww Nifty Total Market Index Fund is an open-ended scheme, tracking the Nifty Total Market index.

The scheme will predominantly invest in equity, while a small portion of funds will be invested in debt and debt market instruments.

Under this new scheme, there will be two plans namely, Regular Plan and Direct Plan. The open and close dates of the NFO are yet to be announced.

A regular plan is for investors who wish to route their investment through any distributor, while the direct plan is only for investors purchasing/subscribing to units directly.

The index fund launch by Groww comes just a few days after its rival Zerodha Asset Management announced the launch of two of its passive index fund schemes Zerodha Tax
Saver (ELSS) Nifty Large Midcap 250 Index Fund and Zerodha Nifty Large Midcap 250 Index Fund.

Groww entered the mutual fund business through the acquisition of Indiabulls Asset Management earlier this year. The discount broking firm received approval from the competition watchdog for the acquisition in September 2021.

Several discount broking firms are getting into the booming asset management business with growing investor participation in markets.

Angel One also received approval from Sebi in February to launch its mutual fund business. The company hopes to start operations in 2024.

Earlier this year, the capital market regulator issued regulations for online platforms like Paytm, Zerodha, and Groww that offer transactions in direct plans for mutual fund schemes, which it calls execution-only platforms.

The September futures were trading at Rs 7,248/bbl, down Rs 57 or 0.78% over Wednesday's closing price. However, the outlook remains positive, believe experts.

After a strong rally, crude oil futures are witnessing some profit-booking at higher levels, but the overall trend remains positive, and a buy-on-dips strategy is recommended, analyst Anuj Gupta, Head Commodity & Currency at HDFC Securities, told ETMarkets. He suggests a buy at Rs 7,050 with a stop loss of Rs 6,950 and a target of Rs 7,300.

The prices are at 10-month high levels, the analyst informed.

Crude oil futures have gained 5.47% or Rs 377/bbl in September while the year-to-day gains stand at Rs 694 or 10.59%, Gupta said.

Analyst Prathamesh Mallya, Deputy Vice President, Research, Non-Agro Commodities & Currency at Angel One, believes that the uptick in prices is on the back of declining US inventories and sustained production cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia, and the situation could remain as it is, going ahead.

Earlier, Reuters reported the US crude oil inventories were projected to fall by 5.5 million barrels in the week ending September 1, quoting market sources in the American Petroleum Institute. Official inventory data from the US Energy Information Administration is due at 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT) on Thursday.

Mallya said that the price surged on Tuesday following the announcements of Saudi Arabia and Russia extending their voluntary oil supply reductions through the end of the year, with Saudi cutting 1 million barrels per day (bpd) and Russia reducing production by 300,000 bpd.

The cuts in production have been at the behest of OPEC+ members, who have agreed to continue reductions until the end of 2024.

Brokerage firm Geojit said that another leg of a bullish rally will begin once crude surpasses the $88 mark. The intraday outlook remains on the bullish side, and rallies would extend the day, the brokerage note said. It has, however, warned investors against slippages, hinting at weakness below the Rs 7,000 mark on the MCX.

It sees support at Rs 7,195/7,085/7,025 while resistance at Rs 7,365/7,425/7,535.

"Sep 07, 2023, 11:03 AM IST",From hitlist to wishlist! New-age tech stocks outpace conventional sectors on Dalal Street,"So far in the current financial year, all the listed new-age consumer tech stocks have given double-digit returns, and stocks like Zomato look set to turn a multibagger soon.Shares of new-age consumer technology companies have possibly left most conventional sectors behind by making a strong comeback in FY24.

Thanks to the recovery in the technology stocks globally and the consistent improvement in earnings, Dalal Street investors are moving their eyes from the “sell” to the “buy” button.

So far in the current financial year, all the listed new-age consumer tech stocks have given double-digit returns, and stocks like Zomato look set to turn a multibagger soon.



That the faith is coming back in these stocks reflects in the shareholding pattern of institutional investors.

Mutual Funds have increased their holding in Zomato for four quarters in a row. As of June end, their cumulative holding stood at 8.3%, compared to a meagre 2.4% in the same period a year ago.

Similarly in FSN E-Commerce, MFs increased their stake for three consecutive quarters, taking their cumulative holding to 8.5% at the end of June quarter. In the same quarter last year, they held a mere 1.9% stake in the online beauty products retailer.

In Paytm, mutual funds were holding just 1% in December 2021, but it went up to 2.52% in the June quarter.

Prior to listing, most new-age technology companies enjoyed valuation premium on account of scalability, niche markets and runway for growth.

""But post listing, investors started discounting valuation when the earnings performance was not inline with the potential that was embedded in valuation,"" said Vaibhav Shah, fund manager, Torus Oro PMS.

One of the major factors driving investors back into these counters recently is the improvement in their earnings performance.

“Until last year, these stocks were not even in their (investors) radar. But now, they have started looking into them because companies shifted focus to improving profitability rather than chasing growth at any cost,” said Manish Chowdhury, head of research, Stoxbox.

Zomato reported its first-ever net profit in the quarter ended June, and this was much ahead of its guided timeline of the end of FY24, thanks to a whopping 71% growth in revenue.

Meanwhile, companies such as Delhivery, Paytm, and PB Fintech significantly trimmed their losses in the June quarter from the year-ago period.


What should investors do?

Indeed, money managers are not as bearish on the sector as they were probably a year ago. But at the same time, not all are screaming a “buy” on the stocks.

“Profitability still remains a concern and we would look at sustainability and consistency of profitability before entering this segment,” Shah of Torus Oro said.

But one stock that a majority of analysts have their eyes on is Zomato.

Sneha Poddar of Motilal Oswal Financial Services is extremely positive on the online food delivery aggregator from a long-term perspective, and has a “buy” rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 125.

Zomato is expected to put up an all-round performance, as competitive intensity is getting accommodative both in food delivery and quick commerce verticals, and the company is likely to breakeven in the next 4 quarters, led by wallet share gains.

"Sep 07, 2023, 10:51 AM IST",Method to madness? Why investors are pouring in thousands of crores into tiny SME IPOs,"The exceptionally huge interest in SME IPOs comes even as mainboard offers are doing well and also despite the inherent risks associated with this segment, such as limited disclosure and lack of liquidity.A Chennai-based VFX studio that has come up with an IPO of Rs 66 crore in the SME segment saw a subscription of 286 times, which is unheard of, at least in the recent past.

Basilic Fly Studio's issue received bids of over Rs 14,000 crore, following a massive demand from investors across categories.

The investor euphoria is not just limited to this one IPO but can be seen as a broad trend for most of the SME issues in 2023, backed by listing gains going through the roof.

For instance, last week, about three companies -- Shoora Designs, Sungarner Energies, and Bonada Engineering, debuted on the SME platforms of both BSE and NSE and all three have doubled investors' wealth on listing day. Sungarner went a step further and delivered over 200% returns on the first day.

The IPO of Sungarner was subscribed by an overwhelming 152 times at close, while that of Bonada Engineering was booked 106 times.

Other IPOs like Srivari Spices, Drone Destination, and Oriana Power have also received significant oversubscription of over 100x, resulting in their shares trading at a much higher price than their initial offering. The Rs 9 crore public issue of Srivari Spices was subscribed 450 times, and Rs 59 crore issue of Oriana Power saw 176 times subscription.

Overall, about 100 SME firms have raised a record Rs 2,600 crore of funds in the SME segment in 2023, breaking the previous record of Rs 2,287 crore raised in 2018 by 141 firms, according to an ET report.

This exceptionally huge interest in SME IPOs comes even as mainboard offers are doing well and also despite the inherent risks associated with this segment, such as limited disclosure and lack of liquidity.

Listing gains might be the biggest factor driving investors to rally behind SME IPOs and most of these companies have not disappointed.

""The returns, which retail investors have been generating in just a short span of time, are very lucrative, retaining their interest in the SME segment,"" said Aastha Jain of Hem Securities.

About 26 SME IPOs in 2023 have offered returns of over 100% since the listing. Out of the 70-plus issues in the segment this year, only eight companies are trading in the red post debut.

Analysts say the other reason behind investors' money chasing SME IPOs is the increase in participation of anchor investors.

""Investors are getting an opportunity to invest in emerging and non-conventional businesses, which may not always be the case with mainboard IPOs. Further, the heightened involvement of anchor investors in SME IPOs generates investor confidence in allocating a substantial portion of their funds towards these offerings,"" said Sunil Nyati, Managing Director of Swastika Investmart.

SMEs are emerging as an acceptable asset class among institutional investors, especially given the growing startup ecosystem with innovative business models.

""Domestic fund houses are increasingly fancying SME IPOs with rising inflows. In the QIB category of some of the issues, there is a huge response, which further raises confidence of retail investors to go ahead and put their money,"" Jain further said.

""Companies listed on the SME exchanges have better profitability ratios, higher return on assets and asset utilization ratios as well as the debt-equity ratio compared with the smallest 25% of firms listed on the main board,"" Nyati added.

Avinash Gorakshakar of Profitmart Securities said the appetite of investors is entirely dependent on the sector in which the SME company is operating. ""If the company is from a niche industry, let's say Basilic Fly Studio, it will garner a significant response. Also, the alpha of making money in SME IPOs is large.""

Will the SME party continue?
Analysts say the trend of significant investor interest in SME IPOs has only just started and if the quality of these offerings, including their fundamentals and pricing, remains consistent, it has the potential to expand even further.

""It is anticipated that significant movement will continue in the Indian IPO market, specifically SMEs,"" Nyati said.

Gorakshakar, however, said the current euphoria in SMEs cannot continue forever. ""Very selective companies in this basket are good, and most are mediocre when it comes to performance. The valuations are going through the rough and there will be a break at some point.""

Kranthi Bathini, Director-Equity Strategy at WealthMills Securities opines that the outperformance of the auto sector will likely continue going ahead in the wake of the upcoming festive season.

Sharekhan expects automobile players to continue their focus on premiumisation, new product launches and EBITDA margin expansion in FY24. In its view, the bottom-line growth will be driven by improvement in operating performance as volume growth is expected to moderate due to a high base while remaining healthy.

Within more than two dozen auto stocks under its coverage, the domestic brokerage has a buy view on 20 stocks including Maruti, Tata Motors, TVS Motors, Eicher Motors, Bajaj Auto, Ashok Leyland, M&M and Hero MotoCorps. In the ancillary segment, the preferred stocks include Amara Raja Batteries, Apollo Tyres, Bosch, Gabriel India, Rolex Rings, Ramkrishna Forgings, and others.

It holds a positive view on CIE Automotive India, Sterling Tools and Rolex Rings; a ‘Hold’ on Balkrishna Industries and Greaves Cotton while a ‘Neutral’ stance on Escorts Kubota and VST Tillers and Tractors.

The pecking order for brokerage LKP is PVs, 2Ws and CVs. It picks M&M on its ""strength in the proliferating SUV segment"", prudent capital allocation and a robust growth strategy in utility vehicles, EVs and commercial vehicles (CVs). MSIL is another top pick on the PV side as the largest Indian passenger car maker offers a wide portfolio of vehicles, it said.

In two-wheelers, Bajaj Auto and TVS find favour from LKP. The former gains strength in EV space from Chetak and the upcoming launch of e-3W will be an additional positive, LKP said. Ashok Leyland is its top pick in the CV space. It recommends buying on dips in these stocks.

In a recent review of Maruti Suzuki stock, Morgan Stanley took an 'Overweight stance, estimating a target of Rs 11,963.

LKP called August auto sales a mixed bag with 2Ws posting weak domestic performance while PV companies posting a strong growth led by the SUV segment.

ET CONTRIBUTORS

The Federation of Automobile Dealers Association of India (FADA) reported August retail sales of passenger vehicles at 3.15 lakh units, up 6.5% YoY while the 2-wheeler retail sales stood at 12.5 lakh units, up 6.3% YoY. Retail sales of CVs and tractors stood at 75,294 and 73,849 units, respectively, which was higher by 3.2% and 13.6% YoY.

Antique in a note said that companies were building inventories ahead of the festive season with PV/2W inventory standing at 40-50 days. Notwithstanding a sharp decline in electric 2W volumes in the previous months following discontinuation of subsidy, a gradual rise in retail is being seen and the volumes could go up 6%-8% MoM from here, the report said.

What Charts Suggest
Technical charts suggest a further upside for the index with select stock playing a strong role towards the upsurge. Technical Analyst Rajesh Palviya expects the 15-stock index to test levels between 16,300-16,400 riding on the ongoing momentum.

""Nifty Auto index is now nearing its all-time high levels and is in a bullish trend with a rounding bottom formation taking place and the momentum can continue for more time. There is a strong buying action happening in auto stocks and it appears that there is no worry as of now,” Palviya said.

Maruti, M&M and TVS Motors have given a breakout and look good at this juncture. Tata Motors can be bought with a short to medium-term perspective and though it is seeing some consolidation, the long-term prospects remain optimistic for this counter, he further said.

Buy Maruti Suzuki | Target: Rs 11,000 - Rs 11,200 | Stop Loss: Rs 9,800
Buy M&M | Target: Rs 1,750 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,520
Buy TVS Motor | Target: Rs 1,580 - Rs 1,640 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,400
Buy Tata Motors | Rs 690 | Stop Loss: 607

These state-owned enterprises continue to be major players in India's energy production and distribution, which underscores the significance of government involvement in the energy industry.Bhatia expressed optimism about the energy sector's valuations, suggesting that populist measures are unlikely to negatively impact them.For more details, watch the accompanying videoFirst Published: Sept 7, 2023 3:50 PM ISTFirst Published: Sept 7, 2023 3:50 PM ISTFirst Published: Sept 7, 2023 3:50 PM IST","By CNBC-TV18

On Thursday, the scrip gained over 2 percent to hit a day's high of Rs 5,105.00 apiece.

Volume ShockersDixon is transitioning away from slow-growing segments and where it has a large 30 per cent-plus market share to new EMS segments, exports and component manufacturing. As per Kotak, Dixon has the right credentials for the first two, thanks to free cash flow to invest, customer references and PLI scheme.In the component manufacturing, the company depends on external support — the government’s ability to incentivise collaboration with global majors for Indian companies, Kotak said.The brokerage has initiated coverage on Dixon Technologies Ltd with a 'Sell' rating and a target price of Rs 4,000, implying a 21 percent potential downside for the counter from the current market levels. Kotak has factored in a reasonable upside from the transition. It said its target multiple implies a revenue CAGR of 16 percent over FY2025-45, relying heavily on the success of the transition.""With most markets Dixon operates in likely to grow volumes at 1X GDP over the medium term, the revenue growth yields stiff conditions for its market share. This implies a 40-45 percent market share in the mobile and laptop or tablet segments by 2036 and 70-80 percent market share by 2046. We place the burden of additional growth on the market share of these two segments, as the case for brands outsourcing more to EMS players is largely limited to these segments, in our view,"" it said.Kotak expects Dixon to broadly maintain its current business returns in the EMS business over time. Taking any improvement in business returns would be too much to expect from the EMS business of Dixon beyond the period of PLI support, it said.The brokerage highlighted that Dixon’s business mix will transition over time to being dominated by segments that face competition from global majors. ""Though asset turnovers will increase, the benefit of the same would be negated by a lower margin.""FinancialsKotak expects Dixon's EBITDA/PAT to increase at a CAGR of 35 percent/42 percent during FY2023-26E. As per the brokerage, the EBITDA margin is likely to marginally improve to 4.3 percent over this period, as improvements in consumer electronics get largely negated by a sharp scale-up in the lower-margin mobile business.It expects Dixon to generate operating cash flow and free cash flow of Rs 19 billion and Rs 5 billion during FY2024-26.As per Kotak, past trends suggest sharp volatility in cash flows, margin and revenues of select EMS players in mobile phone. Dixon's success in component manufacturing depends on the government's ability to incentivise the collaboration with global majors for Indian companies, it said.First Published: Sept 7, 2023 3:59 PM ISTFirst Published: Sept 7, 2023 3:59 PM ISTFirst Published: Sept 7, 2023 3:59 PM IST","By Meghna Sen

The issue was subscribed nearly 33 times.

Sep 07 2023 | 6:52 PM IST,Rupee closes at record low against US dollar amid global slowdown concerns,"The Indian rupee hit a fresh closing low on Thursday as persistent concerns about a slowdown in China and the possibility of further rate hikes in the US weighed heavily on investors’ minds. Public sector banks sold dollars on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which prevented a sharper fall, currency dealers said.

The current market sentiment appears dull, with a noticeable absence of catalysts for optimism, the dealers said.

The domestic currency ended the day at 83.21 a dollar compared to 83.14 on Wednesday. It had touched an intra-day low of 83.22 a dollar. The previous all-time closing low for the rupee was 83.15, on August 17.

“Weakness in equity markets, a rising US Dollar Index, and a slump in Chinese external trade are weighing on the sentiments. Over the near term, we could see USDINR cross the current all-time high of 83.29 [intra-day] and head higher towards 83.60/80 levels. Therefore, we expect a broad range of 82.80 and 83.60 over the near term,” Anindya Banerjee, vice-president (currency derivatives & interest rate derivatives) at Kotak Securities, said.

While domestic fundamentals have stayed strong, external factors continue to pressure the Indian currency. The rupee has depreciated by 0.5 per cent in the first week of September, while it depreciated by 0.6 per cent in August.

In the current financial year, the rupee has depreciated by 1.25 per cent. It fell 7.8 per cent in the previous financial year (FY23). In the current calendar year, the rupee has depreciated by 0.6 per cent.

HDB Financial Services, a non-banking financial company (NBFC) floated by the country's largest private sector lender, HDFC Bank, mopped up only Rs 720 crore against its intent of taking up to Rs 1,800 crore through 23-month non-convertible debentures (NCDs).

The privately placed bonds of HDB Financial had a base issue size of Rs 600 crore, plus a green shoe option of Rs 1,200 crore. The coupon (also known as yield) was fixed at 7.7 per cent. HDB’s paper carries an “AAA” rating from CRISIL, which on September 1, assigned a rating for Rs 20,000 crore worth of NCDs.

In another case, large mortgage lender LIC Housing Finance raised Rs 941 crore against an indicative amount of Rs 1,500 crore. This bond with 59-month maturity, which was also placed privately, had a base issue size of Rs 500 crore, plus a green shoe option of Rs 1,000 crore. The coupon (also known as yield) was fixed at 7.77 per cent.

Bond market dealers said the big-ticket fundraise had slowed down. Only small-ticket issues are going through. For instance, Varroc Engineering raised Rs 250 crore through a five-year bond at a coupon of 9.2 per cent. Its NCDs carry an “A+” rating from India Ratings.

Microfinance company Spandana Sphoorty raised Rs 100 crore through debentures having an 18-month maturity at a coupon of 10.43 per cent. The debentures carry an “A” rating from India Ratings, bond dealers said.

Sep 07 2023 | 6:45 PM IST,Bond yields decline as RBI seeks views on settlement via Euroclear platform,"Government bond yields on Thursday fell after reports that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is seeking views from market participants on the settlement of bonds via the Euroclear platform, as foreign portfolio investors viewed the development positively.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond fell by 3 basis points to settle at 7.18 per cent, against 7.21 per cent on Wednesday.

The RBI is in preliminary discussions with a limited group of participants in the bond market to gauge the potential ramifications of enabling the settlement of domestic sovereign bonds through the Euroclear platform.

The potential settlement of domestic currency bonds through an Euroclear-like offshore platform has been a long-standing topic of discussion. Such a development has the potential to streamline the inclusion of Indian bonds in global indices.

“Euroclear in itself is not significant. What is important is that it just makes it easier to access the Indian bond market, and it is a way to bond inclusion, that is what is important,” said Naveen Singh, head of trading & EVP at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership.

“And if bond inclusion happens, there will be a new set of buyers and demand for bonds will increase. The risk associated is that the discussion has been going on for years but it didn't materialise because of something or the other, and there are chances that it might not happen,” Singh said.

People aware of the developments said several brokers recently met with the exchange to register their grievances. Apart from this, the Association of National Exchanges Members of India (ANMI), an industry body, has separately written to the NSE regarding the same, the HBL report said.

Brokers also met the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) officials, who assured brokers of addressing the issue. A senior official at one of the broker firms told HBL that the penalties have severely affected the brokers as they struggle to survive in the fiercely competitive financial landscape.

Another broker said there could be genuine IT-related technical glitches that prevent timely uploading of required files, or accurately capture the amounts for margin penalty. Adding to this, the broker said that the timelines for meeting some of the new regulations are very, very short, and there could be delays in meeting them, the broker told HBL. Exchanges and regulators should consider relaxations in all such cases, he said.

Sebi has made it compulsory for all stock brokers to deposit all client funds to clearing corporations as of September 1. Stock brokers can no longer retain clients' funds on an end-of-day basis.

Sep 07 2023 | 11:48 AM IST,India's $775 bn stock boom at risk as small caps show signs of overheating,"By Ashutosh Joshi and Akshay Chinchalkar

The rally in Indian equities that has swelled the market’s total valuation by $775 billion in a little more than five months has been accompanied by a notable shift in investor preference to smaller stocks.
  That poses risks as gauges of small and mid-cap shares show signs of overheating, and as the domestic economic outlook becomes more clouded ahead of national elections next year.

Smaller companies are seen benefiting more from the ongoing recovery in India’s capital expenditure. Larger stocks, in contrast, have been relatively restrained by worry over the impact of a possible global recession on the nation’s major IT firms, as well as fallout from a short-seller campaign against the sprawling group controlled by billionaire Gautam Adani.

The trend is the opposite to what has been seen in the US stock market, which has been driven by a handful of technology megacaps surging on the boom in artificial intelligence, leaving small caps in the dust.

The Nifty Midcap 100 Index has risen 37 per cent from a March low, compared with a 16 per cent gain in the blue-chip NSE Nifty 50 Index, driving the ratio of the former to the latter to an all-time high. The previous such peak in early 2018 was followed by a drop of about 25 per cent in the midcap gauge over the next nine months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Investors are still looking to bet on one of the world’s fastest growing economies, driving the Southeast Asian nation’s equity benchmarks to a series of record highs over the past two decades. And the shift in leadership away from the biggest names has been fueled by a flood of funds from retail investors, indicating broader participation in the market.

"Sep 07, 2023, 12:04 PM IST","JK Paper, West Coast Paper, Orient Paper, Seshasayee: Paper stocks rally up to 52% in 30 days. Here's why","After defence and railways, one sectoral theme that has delivered solid gains to investors recently is paper. Shares of at least nine paper manufacturers rallied 30-50 per cent in the last one month while 11 others climbed 10-30 per cent during the same period on positive sectoral outlook. Analysts said global pulp prices fell quite a bit between January-May and that Indian industry did not make price corrections. They said the new education policy may boost revenue for the sector in the medium term and that ban on single-use plastics also augers well for paper industry. Many paper companies have also seen improvement in balance sheets over last couple of years, they noted.According to IPMA, paper consumption in India will likely reach 30 million tonnes by March 2027. There is growing demand from sectors such as FMCG and retail for innovative packaging solutions as they reduce dependency on plastics. ""Paper stocks can also benefit from the rising e-commerce shopping as well as ready-to-eat and packaged foods,"" Nuvama said in a note.Shares of West Coast Paper Mills climbed 52 per cent to Rs 740 a piece from Rs 486.60 level a month ago. Ruchira Papers climbed 41 per cent during the same period. It was followed by Seshasayee Paper and Boards Ltd (37 per cent),Star Paper Mills Ltd (35 per cent), Astron Paper & Board Mill Ltd (35 per cent) and Tamil Nadu Newsprint & Papers Ltd (33 per cent).Paper companies are also optimistic on future prospects. In its annual report, Tamil Nadu Newsprint said exports of paper and converted paper products may stay robust in future. A strong and robust domestic demand coupled with strategic exports of both paper and converted paper products augers well for the Indian paper industry, it said.""All the major paper companies have entered next phase of expansion due to high-capacity utilisation and strong balance sheet position, which provides good upside potential to the stock from FY26-FY27 perspective. Our pecking in this space is JK Paper followed by West Coast Paper Mills,"" Nuvama said.Nuvama said that since the new curriculum is being developed after a gap of 15 years, it would eliminate sale of second-hand books and would lead to strong growth for at least 2-3 years. Completely replacing second-hand textbooks can be a huge opportunity for paper companies with a higher realisation, it said.Besides, it noted that there is a lot of plastic substitution happening with the single-use plastic ban. The substitution will create an additional 2-3 lakh TPA. Due to the high capital investment required to set up a new packaging board plant, only a few large players, such as ITC Ltd, JK Paper, and West Coast Paper Mills, can capitalise on the opportunity, Nuvama noted.Genus Paper & Boards, Orient Paper & Industries, Andhra Paper, Pudumjee Paper Products Ltd, Malu Paper Mills and Mohit Paper Mills surged 20-30 per cent in the last one month. JK Paper is up 19 per cent in the one month period. Balkrishna Paper Mills and Emami Paper Mills gained 14-15 per cent for the period.Global pulp prices reached a record high level in 2022-23 as the demand increased sharply post Covid period. This was further aggravated by higher energy cost in Europe triggered by Russia-Ukraine war, JK Paper said in its annual report las month.“The low inventory of pulp led to panic buying which also pushed the prices further higher. Consequent to this paper prices also moved up significantly. Opening up of China post Covid restrictions was expected to keep demand buoyant. However, Q4 of 2022-23 witnessed demand slowdown as China buying did not pick up as expected resulting in inventory of pulp producers shooting up from normal levels of 30 days to 60 days. This triggered a price correction in pulp prices and may hit their lowest level in coming months,” JK Paper said last month.""Now with the softening of international demand, the pulp quantities available for the Indian markets from China and Indonesia have considerably increased. Furthermore, international pulp prices have moderated considerably which has aided the drop in prices of finished paper. In this background, we are currently witnessing a surge in imports of woodfree grades in large volumes. This trend is likely to continue. Further, the Indian industry did not make price corrections at the appropriate time, which made the imported woodfree grades attractive for an Indian convertor/market,"" Nuvama said.","Tarab Zaidi,",BusinessToday

"Sep 07, 2023, 1:08 PM IST",PVR Inox shares: Can Shah Rukh Khan-starrer 'Jawan' give stock a lift?,"Shares of PVR Inox gained a strong buying interest during the trading session on Thursday as a new Shah Rukh Khan-starrer 'Jawaan' hit the silver screen on September 7. Analysts tracking the stock continue to remain positive on the stock considering the return of masses to the theatres backed by the strong pipeline. However, they say some near-term hiccups for the counter.

After the success of recent movies, PVR has a strong pipeline of 'Salman Khan-starrer 'TIger-3', SRK-starrer 'Dunki' and Prabhas-starrer 'Salaar'. Other than these, a host of actors are queued up with their movies in the festive season, which may draw crowd at the box office.

Shares of PVR Inox gained about 3 per cent to Rs 1,870 on Thursday backed with heavy trading volumes as positive reviews for SRK and Atlee's 'Jawan' swamped over the internet. However, the stock is still 5 per cent below its 52-week high of Rs 1,975 hit about a year ago.

Jinesh Joshi, Research Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher, who gave a positive outlook on the stock, said that PVR Inox has been in momentum since mega releases like 'Gadar-2', 'Jailor' and even 'Dream Girl-2' have also done good at the box office. Also, other movies like 'Satyaprem ki Katha' and 'Rocky Rani ki Prem Kahaani' have done well in terms of numbers.After a robust July and a record August, September is beginning on a very positive note for PVR INOX due to Jawaan, likely Rs 70 crore India collections on day 1. August set new records, which is in a sharp contrast to the discretionary slowdown impacting QSR or apparel. Cinemas and OTT shall both co-exist in India, said Nuvama Institutional Equtiies, citing world cup 2023 as a small risk.""As highlighted in Cinema customers are back, we expect all-time record in Q2FY24 results and are hence increasing FY24E and 25E EPS by 5.2 per cent and 8.4 per cent, respectively. With strong footfalls, ad revenues are likely to see a robust recovery. In spite of the 32 per cent run-up over past few months,"" it said retaining 'buy' with an increased target price of Rs 2,210.""One should wait for Q3 performance, which is the festive quarter, as some more major releases of some the biggest names of Indian cinema are lined up with their much-awaited projects. If the content quality is in-line with the expectations and can deliver decent entertainment, it will bode well for the PVR Inox.""

Joshi said that fresh buying at current levels warrants some caution, as Cricket World Cup 2023 may catch some of the potential eye-balls but its impact will be short-term and the overall outlook continues to remain positive. He advised existing investors to hold the stock for a longer term and do a periodic revision after every quarter.

Analysts believe that more movies in Rs 100 crore club and operational efficiencies and better ATP/SPH will improve the screen economics. Better average ticket price will increase the margins further. However, impact of World Cup 2023 and other events may have their short-lived impact.

The largest film exhibition and multiplex chain PVR Inox shares have been in limelight action since blockbuster releases like 'Gadar-2' and 'Jailor' stormed the box-office collections. We believe the box-office collections would continue to see an uptrend considering Jawan release, said Prashanth Tapse, Research Analyst and Senior VP Research at Mehta Equities.

""It is believed that Shah Rukh Khan surpasses 'Pathaan' collection to create an all-time record in pre-sales. Recent trends in Bollywood movies would bring in a sharp turnaround in multiplex players and exhibitors to get back into profits in coming earnings, We expect Q2 earnings would surprise the street based on a healthy trend in box office collections,"" he said.

Technically, PVR Inox is in the positive zone with support near Rs 1,800 level and resistance above 1900 levels and any close above Rs 1,910 we can expect weekly breakout towards Rs 2,000 mark. Hence traders can continue to hold an optimistic outlook in this counter, Tapse added. ",Tarab Zaidi,BusinessToday

"Sep 07, 2023, 10:56 AM IST","Kotak initiates coverage on Dixon Tech stock with 'Sell' rating, sees 21% potential downside","Dixon, an electronic manufacturing services (EMS) player, is transitioning away from slow-growing segments and where it has a large 30 per cent-plus market share to new EMS segments, exports and component manufacturing. Kotak said Dixon has the right credentials for the first two, thanks to free cash flow to invest, customer references and PLI scheme. In the component manufacturing, Kotak said Dixon depends on external support -- the government’s ability to incentivise collaboration with global majors for Indian companies.Kotak said its share price target is based on 35 times December 2025 earnings per share, which factors in a reasonable upside from the transition. It said its target multiple implies a revenue CAGR of 16 per cent over FY2025-45, relying heavily on the success of the transition.""With most markets that Dixon operates in likely to grow volumes at 1X GDP over the medium term, the revenue growth yields stiff conditions for its market share. This implies a 40-45 per cent market share in the mobile and laptop/tablet segments by 2036 and 70-80 per cent market share by 2046. We place the burden of additional growth on the market share of these two segments, as the case for brands outsourcing more to EMS players is largely limited to these segments, in our view,"" it said.Kotak said the EMS business requires a combination of things to grow beyond CAGR of 15 per cent. It noted that every third TV and semi-automatic washing machine are manufactured/assembled in India by Dixon and imports have become negligible over time. The largest brand that is yet to outsource manufacturing has limitations in giving business to Dixon, given its customer profile, Kotak noted.Kotak said in most categories, market growth has stopped being supportive for Dixon.""TV volumes sold are lower than those during the time of CRT TVs, partly impacted by high GST. Washing machine market sales are stagnating in the semi-automatic market; growth in other segments where the starting point for EMS is low may take time. Lighting volumes are flat to declining over the past few years and the impact of the longer replacement cycle of LED lamps on market growth is in its initial stages. India’s smartphone market operates at 50 per cent of levels where the Chinese market is now starting to stagnate,"" it noted.The case for a healthy double-digit business CAGR, thus, relies on a combination of exports, sharp share gains inmobile and entry into new EMS revenues. ""Dixon would find it difficult to grow its business in mid-double digits without such support,"" it said.","Tarab Zaidi,",BusinessToday

The average target price on the counter at Rs 34 suggests a muted 4 per cent upside potential. Coal India and Apollo Hospitals traded at discounts of 37 per cent and 33 per cent, respectively.

Divi's Labs shares traded at a 49 per cent discount to its historical PE of 32.80 times. But the stock's average target price at Rs 3,354 suggests a 10 per cent potential downside.
