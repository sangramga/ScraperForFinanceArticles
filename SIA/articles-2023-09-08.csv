2023-09-08 12:14:00,"Gold faces headwinds amidst rising crude oil prices, strong US dollar; Fed rate hike speculation looms","By Bhavik PatelGold and silver struggled this week on account of strength in US dollar and Treasury yields. The big highlight this week was the rise in crude oil prices which is at 10 month high. This has increased inflationary pressure which means the US Fed will have to keep rates higher or perhaps one more rate hike before the end of 2023. This pushed the US dollar and yields higher leaving both gold and silver in a downward spiral. Traders are awaiting the next big US economic data point for price direction, likely to be next week’s consumer price index report for August, due out on Wednesday, September 13. $1900 is proving to be solid support for gold and whenever any correction around that zone occurs, buyers become active and start defending the levels. Because of strong USD, gold and silver markets are in bearish near-term technical postures, which are keeping the two precious metals markets bulls very timid.Yesterday the selling pressure got more ammunition as the US labor market remains fairly robust with the number of American workers applying for first-time unemployment claims dropped more than expected last week. The better-than-expected claims data is having an outsized impact on markets as it eases fears of an economic slowdown. Strong labor market indicators may lead the Federal Reserve to stick to its hawkish stance and keep interest rates higher than anticipated. This is what markets don’t want and that is there is strength in USD and Treasury yields. However after the jobs data, Gold and silver both have recovered somewhat indicating profit booking and traders trying to dip their toes and take long positions near support levels.In MCX, after 4 trading sessions of negative closing, we have seen positive opening today. It is too early to predict that support has been established but there is a flurry of buying activity near the support zone of 59,000 – 58,800. We believe fresh momentum on the downside will commence once MCX gold breaches 58,800 on the downside or COMEX gold breaches key support level of $1900. For next week, we can recommend going long around the support zone of 58,800 for an expected target of 59,400 and stoploss of 58,500. One should keep their positions light as the trend may reverse if gold breaches its level of $1900 in COMEX.(Bhavik Patel is a commodity and currency analyst at Tradebull Securities.

2023-09-08 11:09:00,Stock market today: Asian shares track decline on Wall Street as Japan cuts GDP estimate for 2nd quarter,"Much of that growth was driven by exports, which rose nearly 13 per cent, while private consumption fell 2.2 per cent on weak investment spending. A separate report showed that wages declined in July for the 16th straight month, falling 2.5 per cent from a year earlier. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index dropped 0.9 per cent to 32,681.31, while the Kospi in Seoul lost 0.4 per cent to 2,537.69.Hong Kong’s markets were closed due to a tropical storm. The Shanghai Composite index pulled back 0.5 per cent to 3,105.54, while the S and P/ASX 200 fell 0.4 per cent to 7,154.50. On Thursday, Wall Street slipped in mixed trading as the threat of high interest rates continues to dog Big Tech stocks. The S and P 500 fell 0.3 per cent to 4,451.14, for its third straight loss. The Nasdaq composite was hit particularly hard by the drop for tech stocks, sinking 0.9 per cent to 13,748.83.The Dow Jones Industrial Average held up better than the rest of the market because it has less of an emphasis on tech. It rose 0.2 per cent to 34,500.73. Stocks felt pressure from the bond market, where yields rose earlier in the week after a report showed stronger growth for US services industries last month than economists expected. Yields remained high after a report on Thursday said fewer US workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected.While such reports are encouraging for the economy, indicating a long-predicted recession is not near, they could also keep conditions humming strongly enough to push upward on inflation.The Federal Reserve has already hiked its main interest rate to the highest level in more than two decades in hopes of slowing the economy enough to drive inflation back down to its 2 per cent target. It’s come close, and inflation has cooled from its peak above 9 per cent last summer. But the worry is that the last percentage point of improvement may be the toughest for the Fed.High interest rates drag stock prices, especially those of technology companies and others that have been bid up on expectations for high growth far in the future. Many of those stocks also tend to be the most influential on the S and P 500 because they’re the biggest. Apple, the dominant force on Wall Street because it’s the most valuable stock, fell 2.9 per cent after a 3.6 per cent drop a day before.Nvidia sank 1.7 per cent to bring its loss for the week so far to 4.7 per cent. It and a cohort of other stocks in the artificial-intelligence industry have soared this year on expectations that AI could mean explosive future growth in profits. C3.ai tumbled 12.2 per cent after it said late Wednesday that it no longer expects to be profitable in its final fiscal quarter of the year, as it invests more in opportunities around generative AI. Analysts also pointed to disappointing profit margin levels for the company during its latest quarter, which was the first of its fiscal year.Power companies and other stocks seen as steadier investments also held up better than the rest of the market. Utility stocks in the S and P 500 rose 1.3 per cent as a group. That was nearly double the gain of any of the other 10 sectors that make up the index. In other trading on Friday, US benchmark crude oil shed 48 cents to USD 86.39 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It added 67 cents on Thursday.

2023-09-08 10:17:00,"EMS IPO opens for subscription, GMP up 56%; should you subscribe to the issue?","EMS IPO: EMS IPO opens for public subscription on Friday, 8 September, and will close on Tuesday, 12 September. The bidding for anchor investors concluded on Thursday, wherein the company collected Rs 95.37 crore. The price band for its public issue at Rs 200-211 per equity share of face value Rs 10 each. At the upper end of the price band, the company’s promoters and shareholders seek to raise Rs 321.24 crore from the IPO. Ahead of the public issue, EMS shares’ GMP rose to Rs 120 per equity share, 56.87% over the upper end of the share price on offer. The IPO comprises a fresh issue of equity shares worth Rs 146.24 crore and an Offer-For-Sale (OFS) with promoters offloading 82.4 lakh shares worth Rs 175 crore. The company intends to use the net proceeds from the IPO to bolster its capital base, catering to its future capital requirements resulting from business and asset growth. For potential investors, the bidding starts at a minimum of 70 equity shares, with subsequent bids in multiple lots of 70 equity shares each, with a maximum of 13 lots. At the upper end of the price band, the post-issue implied market-cap is Rs 1,1171 crore.EMS is engaged in the business of providing water and wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal services. The company provides Sewerage solutions, Water Supply Systems, Water and Waste Treatment Plants, Electrical Transmission and Distribution, Road and Allied works, operation and maintenance of Wastewater Scheme Projects (WWSPs) and Water Supply Scheme Projects (WSSPs) for government authorities/bodies. WWSPs include Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) along with Sewage Network Schemes and Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) and WSSPs include Water Treatment Plants (WTPs) along with pumping stations and laying of pipelines for the supply of water.“India has 18% of the world’s total population, but only 4% of its water resources, making it among the most water-stressed countries in the world. A large number of Indians face high to extreme water stress, according to a recent report by the government’s policy think tank, the NITI Aayog. India’s dependence on an increasingly erratic monsoon for its water requirements increases this challenge. The World Bank is helping to support the government’s national groundwater program, the Atal Bhujal Yojana, to help improve groundwater management. “EMS has successfully completed 67 projects as on July 31, 2023, and gradually intends to expand its business operations to other regions of the country, especially North-East and South India. Almost all of the company’s projects are World Bank-funded through local state government bodies. This is the main reason for their robust cash flows/timely payments, and no bad debts, which helps them to take on more projects with the help of internal accruals only. As a result, there is savings in the finance cost which helps to improve the profit margin. On the upper price band, the issue is valued at a P/E of 9.1x based on FY2023 earnings, which we feel is fairly valued compared to its peers. We, therefore, recommend an SUBSCRIBE rating for the issue.”“At higher price band, EMS is demanding a P/E multiple of 10.9x (to its FY23 earning), which is at discount to the peer average. Unsustainable expansion in the urbanization seems to be putting pressure on the urban wastewater management, planning and treatment. Backed by the government’s proactive policies, the domestic water & wastewater treatment market is expanding rapidly and has strong outlook in the medium term. With a strong focus on sewage treatment segment, EMS is rightly placed to benefit from the market expansion. Its robust order book & profitability, healthy balance sheet and demanded discounted valuation makes this issue attractive. Thus, we assign a “SUBSCRIBE” rating for the issue.”(The recommendations in this story are by the respective research analysts and brokerage firms.

Petrol rates and diesel rates have been steady over the last few months. However, individual cities see fluctuations in their prices every day. The prices of petrol and diesel change state by state, depending upon various criteria such as Value Added Tax (VAT), freight charges, local taxes, etc.The last country-wide change in fuel rates was on 21 May last year, when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman slashed excise duty on petrol by Rs 8 per litre and Rs 6 per litre on diesel.

ETMarkets did an analysis on stocks that registered more than 40% losses in FY23 and gauged their performance in the current financial year.

The analysis showed that about 11 stocks, with a market capitalization of minimum Rs 500 crore, have turned multibaggers so far in FY24 after clocking more than 40% losses in FY23.


After shedding more than 42% in FY23, shares of Bombay Dyeing have rallied a whopping 166% so far in FY24.

Shares of Jyoti Structures have doubled in value since April after losing 76% in the last financial year.

Similarly, granite maker Pokarna has surged more than 137% in FY24, after correcting a sharp 67% in FY23.

The midcap and smallcap segment as a whole have outpaced large cap stocks since March, even though the rally in the market took benchmark indices to lifetime highs.

Earlier this week, the Nifty Midcap 100 index moved past the psychologically crucial 40000-mark for the first time ever, and the Nifty Smallcap 100 index too, tested its lifetime high.

Both the midcap and smallcap indices are up for the 6th consecutive month, gaining 34% and 41%, respectively.

“We believe that the improving domestic conditions have helped the broader markets with companies driving their earnings growth potential,” said Raj Vyas, VP - Research, Tejimandi.

Even the mutual fund industry has seen strong inflows in both smallcap and midcap funds in the last 4-5 months, against largecap funds, which have witnessed outflows, indicating the strong retail interest in this segment.

What should investors do?
The strong rally in the midcap and smallcap stocks have taken many of them into an overbought zone, making money managers a bit cautious about this segment.

While there are ample opportunities in this segment, they recommend investors to stay stock specific and gauge the risk factors before investing.

“We categorically reject the idea of ‘Buy at any Price’..Being very selective in our stock picking strategy, keeping valuations centric to our approach has enabled us to deliver benchmark beating returns,” said Siddharth Oberoi, fund manager, Prudent Advisory.

Apart from that, we have significant weight in TMT, tech, media and telecom, both IT services and telecommunications.""Manishi Raychaudhuri, Head of Asia-Pacific Equity Strategy, BNP Paribas, says “going forward over the next quarter or so, we are going to face uncertainty about the monetary policy trajectory of the global central banks and naturally, equity markets worldwide and possibly more so in emerging markets would continue to see volatility. But India would remain relatively insulated and one strong reason behind that is the domestic investor enthusiasm that we are seeing right now.”

There is a bit of a global scare, but that is not having an impact on Indian markets per se. FIIs are selling, but DIIs are buying. Do you think we are in for more of the same for the next couple of quarters or next couple of months?
It has been a story of India for quite some time now. Think of the period, October 21 to June 22, there was $23-27 billion of FII selling during that period. What did the market do? Hardly anything. It was down about 5% percent or so. If you go back about 5 to 10 years, that quantum of selling would have made a serious dent in the market. But this new-found enthusiasm on the part of the domestic investors and has been going on for the last three to five years places India in a unique sweet spot among the emerging markets.

There is almost no other emerging market where the domestic interest and domestic action in the equity market have increased to this extent and consequently, no other market where the domestic influence is more than neutralising the fluctuations in FII interest. So, going forward over the next quarter or so, we are going to face uncertainty about the monetary policy trajectory of the global central banks and naturally, equity markets worldwide and possibly more so in emerging markets would continue to see volatility. But India would continue to remain relatively insulated and one strong reason behind that is going to be this domestic investor enthusiasm that we are seeing right now.

Considering India continues to be the preferred destination, where have you added positions or executed fresh buys in your recommendations?
In our Asian model portfolio, we have been overweight in India for about three months now. We were kind of neutral in the first half of this year, but in late June, we turned overweight and the big weight in the India silo are financials, and that is predominantly private banks.

The second important silo is the consumer universe. Things are a bit nuanced here. We have significant weight in autos, consumer discretionaries and we have recently added some bits in consumer staples, the low end as far as the valuations are concerned. We are a bit cautious about valuations in the consumer staples segment. Apart from that, we have significant weight in TMT, tech, media and telecom, both IT services and telecommunications.

When we talk about telecommunications, we are referring both to pure plays and conglomerates. So, if one compares to the benchmark weight, our overweight stance on India is possibly the most pronounced. We do have overweights on Hong Kong, China and Korea also but they are relatively lower in comparison to the benchmark weights of those markets.

Which is the sector that is a very clear underweight, one that you should completely stay away from?
We are not too positive on metals, mining, materials. As long as economic growth in China continues to the point and the real commodity demand boosting sectors like property continue to face turmoil over there, I think it would be prudent for investors to stay away from commodities, particularly materials and mining.

Even though I talked about adding consumer staples in a small weight, for much of the very well penetrated large frontline consumer staples companies in India we are a bit cautious about their growth trajectory going forward, also the kind of valuations that they are trading at. Those are the two sectors that readily come to mind when we talk about staying cautious about certain segments in India.

ET Now: Nobody is working with the assumption that US demand could surprise us, do you think the China concerns will be diluted?
Manishi Raychaudhuri: As far as materials, metals and minings are concerned, the vast majority of consumption, 50-60% are consumed in China. So the only exception I can think of is energy – oil and gas where the western hemisphere still remains in the driver seat as far as proportions of consumption is concerned.


But apart from that, when one talks about industrial metals, China still remains in the driver seat as far as demand goes. The only tiny little exceptions that one can think of are the metals which go into the EV supply chain, the electric vehicle supply chain, because EV demand after suffering for a few quarters, has again revived in China. Those are some bits and pieces of minor exceptions that I would point out but for much of the industrial metals, I would possibly still stay away.

ET Now: What are you making of the big move that one is seeing across categories and defence related themes, pure play defence manufacturers, ship building, even railway stocks. The infra theme has come to the fore and these newer sectors are finding value amongst investors?

Why Karma Capital’s Rushabh Sheth keeps out of defence, railway stocks

Manishi Raychaudhuri: In fact that is a very interesting point to make. And my apologies, I did not mention one of the core sectors that we are focused on in India. In fact, industrials is a sector that we added sometime in June to our Indian side of the portfolio. And for exactly the reason that you pointed out. The government expenses on infrastructure has been going up steadily. If one looks at government capex as a proportion of total government expenditure for the past three to four years, it has really skyrocketed. It used to be about 15 to 17%. It has gone up to 25% in the latest budget. Much of this is coming in railways, in shipping, in port and other inland transportation so intra city mass rapid transit.


So these are the sectors and, of course, one cannot forget defence. These are the sub segments within government capex that we are positive on. We think that it would also have a rub-off effect on private sector capex. One cannot forget the China plus one story here as well. We are seeing the initial nascent signs of that. All in all, we remain focused and positive on the capex story in India and our inclusion of industrials is a reflection of that constructive attitude.

ET Now: Industrial's positivism is something which is quite visible but is this view valid for even the power stocks?
Manishi Raychaudhuri: In power stocks, one has to be a bit nuanced because the focus of India much like most of the emerging markets and the developed markets is possibly going towards green transition. That is where much of the incremental expenditure, much of the incremental policy initiatives would possibly be focused on. We do not have any specific stock but much of the frontline industrial companies are also engaged in that area. It is a space that we would definitely be watching carefully.",,Economic Times
2023-09-08 09:56:00,EMS IPO opens for subscription. Should you invest in this issue?,"Analysts advised investors to subscribe to the IPO over fair valuations, robust order book, and strong execution capabilities with vast industry experience.The initial public offer of water and sewage infra player EMS opened for public subscription. The issue, which closes on September 12, comprises a fresh equity issue of Rs 146 crore and an OFS of 82.94 lakh shares.

Analysts advised investors to subscribe to the IPO over fair valuations, robust order book, and strong execution capabilities with vast industry experience.

EMS offers water and sewage infra solutions, including laying the network to build sewage and water treatment plants in the northern states of UP, Bihar, Uttarakhand, and Rajasthan.

The company has executed 67 projects over the past 13 years and has an order book of Rs 1,775 crore, which includes 18 ongoing projects.

""On the upper price band, the issue is valued at a P/E of 9.1x based on FY2023 earnings, which we feel is fairly valued compared to its peers. We, therefore, recommend a Subscribe rating for the issue,"" said Stoxbox.

The company has fixed a price band of Rs 200-211. About 50% of the offer is reserved for qualified institutional buyers (QIB), 15% for non-institutional investors, and the rest 35% for retail investors.

""EMS has a strong in-house designing, engineering, and execution team. They have a strong execution capability with industry experience. We believe that the issue is reasonably priced and recommend Subscribe rating to the IPO,"" said Anand Rathi.

Some of the company's competitive strengths include a healthy order book, experienced management team, strong execution, and in-house designing capabilities.

On the risk front, EMS is heavily dependent on government projects and the business is working capital intensive, due to which high liquidity is required.

""This IPO will give us a boost in meeting the company's working capital needs and improve its eligibility for high-value projects,"" the company's promoter Ramveer Singh had said earlier.

In FY23, total revenues from operations stood at Rs 538 crore. EBITDA for the same period was at Rs 149 crore, and PAT stood at Rs 108.62 crore.
Khambatta Securities is the sole book-running lead manager to the issue, while KFin Technologies is the registrar.

The stock broke out from an 8-month consolidation range earlier in the month of August 2023. The stock hit a high of 36 levels on 15th December 2022 but it failed to hold on to the momentum.

The stock went into a corrective phase where it found support above the 200-DMA on the daily chart. The stock eventually broke out above 36 levels on 9th August 2023.

It has also witnessed a breakout from a falling trendline on the quarterly charts which has opened room for the stock to head towards 80 levels, suggest experts.

The stock has been resisting the falling trend line from the past three quarters & has finally taken out in the current quarter,” Sujit Deodhar, Head - Technical Analyst, Wellworth Share & Stock Broking Ltd., said.

The PSU bank index has been an outperformer in the past many quarters & the smaller banks have the largest participation in it.

“Since Bank of Maharashtra stock has witnessed a multi-year breakout, the stock should be seen as a positional bet rather than just for trading,” he said.

“On daily charts, the stock has been trading above all its major long-term moving averages (50,100&200SMA) exhibiting the underlying strength,” highlights Deodhar.

“One can buy this stock at current levels of 41.85 & on any dips towards 36.50 levels for positional target of 85 levels with protective stop loss below 29 levels & a holding period of next 3-4 quarters,” he recommends.

On being appointed as the latest member to the College's Court of Regents, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said: ""I am humbled and deeply honoured to be appointed Regent of the Royal College of Surgeons Edinburgh. As the oldest surgical college in the world with just under 30,000 members in 100 countries, the RCSed has been championing the highest standards of surgical and dental practice by providing high quality medical education. I look forward to contributing to the College's mission and advancing the frontiers of surgical excellence.""

The RCSed's Court of Regents comprises a group of distinguished and accomplished individuals in their field who provide the College with advice and expertise. The concept of the RCSEd Court of Regents dates back to 1980, when College President at the time, Professor John Gillingham, noted the success of the Court in the Australasian College. Professor Gillingham discussed his idea for a Court of Regents with a Lord Kadoorie in Hong Kong, who agreed to become one of the first members. Initially ten members were elected, none of whom had medical backgrounds. Currently, the College has several active Regents and several Emeritus Regents.


The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh is a prestigious Scottish medical association which was founded in 1505 by Royal Charter granted from King James IV. It is the oldest Surgical Colleges in the world with nearly 30,000 members in 100 countries, and about half of them are from overseas, touching every stage of career path from medical students to consultants.

The RCSed holds a rich history of promoting excellence in the field of surgery. It plays a pivotal role in training and certifying surgeons, ensuring the highest standards of surgical practice worldwide. With a global reach, it provides a platform for knowledge exchange, research collaboration, and professional development within the surgical community.

The RCSed is not only a symbol of tradition but also a beacon of innovation, embracing cutting-edge technologies and techniques to enhance patient care and surgical outcomes. Its commitment to advancing surgical knowledge and fostering the next generation of surgeons makes it an invaluable institution in the realm of medical science and healthcare.


Headquartered in Edinburgh, Scotland, the RCSEd has another location at Birmingham's prestigious Colmore Row, UK. It also has an international office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, catering to its growing international membership.

It said its target multiple implies a revenue CAGR of 16 percent over FY2025-45, relying heavily on the success of the transition.""With most markets Dixon operates in likely to grow volumes at 1X GDP over the medium term, the revenue growth yields stiff conditions for its market share. This implies a 40-45 percent market share in the mobile and laptop or tablet segments by 2036 and 70-80 percent market share by 2046. We place the burden of additional growth on the market share of these two segments, as the case for brands outsourcing more to EMS players is largely limited to these segments, in our view,"" it said.Kotak expects Dixon to broadly maintain its current business returns in the EMS business over time. Taking any improvement in business returns would be too much to expect from the EMS business of Dixon beyond the period of PLI support, it said.The brokerage highlighted that Dixon’s business mix will transition over time to being dominated by segments that face competition from global majors. ""Though asset turnovers will increase, the benefit of the same would be negated by a lower margin.""FinancialsKotak expects Dixon's EBITDA/PAT to increase at a CAGR of 35 percent/42 percent during FY2023-26E.

Volume ShockersWhile the recent run-up in gold prices has led to near-term postponement of demand, Titan has historically performed well when gold prices surged.During 2008-13, when gold prices went up by a 24.8 percent CAGR (compound annual growth rate), Titan's jewellery EBIT and overall PAT clocked a CAGR of 49.7 percent and 35.6 percent, respectively. During the same period, its share price saw a 32 percent CAGR. Since its making charges are based on the percentage of the value of gold, the margin will improve after a lag, Motilal said.Titan's medium- to long-term earnings growth opportunity is best-of-breed, reflected in five-year sales, EBITDA and PAT CAGRs of 20.3 percent, 24.3 percent, and 23.9 percent, respectively.Titan shares were trading nearly a percent higher at Rs 3,185.95 apiece on the NSE on Friday, September 8.The stock, in which investor Rekha Rakesh Jhunjhunwala has a stake, rallied 33 percent in the past six months.

Volume ShockersCNBC-TV18 was the first to report about the order, which is likely to be valued at nearly Rs 24,000 crore. However, L&T has yet to make an official exchange announcement regarding the same.Reacting to this potential order win, shares of L&T rose 4 percent on Thursday, September 8, to close at a record high.Almost 38 out of the 41 analysts that track L&T now have a buy recommendation on the stock. Six of those expect the stock to reach its or trade above its buyback price of Rs 3,000. L&T had announced a share buyback worth Rs 10,000 crore up to a price of Rs 3,000 apiece.Here's a look at what some brokerages had to say:Brokerage firm CLSA has maintained its buy rating on L&T and raised its price target higher to Rs 3,240. This is the highest target on the street for L&T. The brokerage said that the large fossil and non-fossil Middle East (West Asia) order is a catalyst for the target price revision.CLSA wrote that L&T was one of the few preferred contractors of Saudi Aramco with its long presence in the Middle East and competency. ""By the time the orders are placed & EPS gets visible, expect the stock to re-rate,"" the note said.Another brokerage that expects the L&T stock to go beyond Rs 3,000 is Citi. It has maintained its buy recommendation on the stock with a price target of Rs 3,175. While the Middle East order is not official yet, Citi noted that L&T had increased its prospects size post the June quarter results for the financial year 2024 due to expansion in hydrocarbon prospects.A buyback of Rs 10,000 crore at Rs 3,000 per share further adds to shareholder confidence, according to Citi. The note also highlighted L&T's balance sheet improvement, better-working capital and consistent improvement in consolidated Return on Equity (RoE).Morgan Stanley believes that the order in question accounts for 13 percent of the company's annual guidance and 17 percent of core order inflows. The brokerage said that Saudi Arabia is undergoing an unprecedented transformation with nearly $1 trillion in gigaproject commitments and rapid demographic shifts. Morgan Stanley remains overweight on L&T with a price target of Rs 2,935.Shares of L&T have now risen nearly 40 percent so far in 2023.(Edited by : Hormaz Fatakia)

GAIL (India) Ltd has 49.21 per cent interest and Gujarat State Petrochemical Corp (GSPC) has the remaining 1.43 per cent.The ONGC board last week approved a financial restructuring of the petchem firm which had been making losses due to its high debt.ONGC will convert share warrants into equity, buy-back debentures and invest Rs 7,000 crore more equity, which will give it about 95 per cent stake, the company said in a stock exchange filing.The proposal approved includes ""conversion of share warrants issued by OPaL and subscribed by ONGC into equity shares upon payment of final call money of Rs 86.281 crore at the rate of Rs 0.25 per warrant,"" it said.Also, ONGC will ""buy-back compulsory convertible debentures (CCDs) of Rs 7,778 crore."" CCDs issued by OPaL with backstopping support of ONGC are presently held by financial institutions.ONGC will also invest Rs 7,000 crore in equity/quasi-equity security of OPaL, it said.Upon implementation, OPaL would become a subsidiary of ONGC, it added.The financial restructuring ""will augment the holding of ONGC in OPaL and OPaL will become more profitable,"" it said, adding that the total cost of acquisition would be Rs 14,864.281 crore.OPaL was incorporated on November 15, 2006, as a mega, grassroots petrochemical complex to use naphtha produced by ONGC at Hazira as well as rich-gas being imported at Dahej.It is an anchor tenant of Dahej PCPIR, Gujarat and has exported its products to more than 50 countries.OPaL mega petrochemical complex has a capacity to produce 1.5 million tonne per annum of polymers (1,100 kilo tonne per annum (KTPA) ethylene, 400 KTPA propylene), 0.5 million tonne of chemicals, and several other products through the associated units of pyrolysis gasoline hydrogenation unit, butadiene extraction unit and benzene extraction unit.GAIL had in 2008 picked up a stake in OPaL, which was then building the mega petrochemical complex at Dahej. But the project faced major cost and time overruns and GAIL decided to restrict its equity contribution to the original Rs 996.28 crore.The plant, which at the time of conception was projected to cost Rs 12,440 crore, was completed only in 2017 at a cost of about Rs 30,000 crore.GAIL and GSPC will now together hold close to 5 per cent in OPaL post-financial restructuring.ONGC had invested about Rs 4,400 crore as equity and warrants in OPaL. As a Maharatna PSU, it is permitted to invest only up to Rs 5,000 crore in a joint venture.OPaL's accumulated losses touched Rs 13,000.3 crore on March 31, 2023.",Written By: PTI,Zee Business

""We can have consistency in staffing across the store, have better customer service and allow for new opportunities for associates to learn things,"" Hatfield said.Shares of the company rose about 1 per cent in afternoon trade. Walmart's move comes at a time when U.S. job growth data in August showed that the labor market was slowing in response to the U.S. central bank's hefty rate hikes to cool demand in the economy, which has already started to see demand waver for discretionary items.Reuters reported in August that Walmart was asking some of its 16,000 pharmacists across the United States to voluntarily take pay cuts by reducing their working hours in a bid to lower costs. Still, the retailer has fared better than rivals because of its focus on groceries, which are becoming a larger portion of consumers' budgets at a time when their wallets are squeezed by inflation. The company raised its full-year forecasts for the second-time this year in August.

HDB Financial Services, a non-banking financial company (NBFC) floated by the country's largest private sector lender, HDFC Bank, mopped up only Rs 720 crore against its intent of taking up to Rs 1,800 crore through 23-month non-convertible debentures (NCDs).

The privately placed bonds of HDB Financial had a base issue size of Rs 600 crore, plus a green shoe option of Rs 1,200 crore. The coupon (also known as yield) was fixed at 7.7 per cent. HDB’s paper carries an “AAA” rating from CRISIL, which on September 1, assigned a rating for Rs 20,000 crore worth of NCDs.

In another case, large mortgage lender LIC Housing Finance raised Rs 941 crore against an indicative amount of Rs 1,500 crore. This bond with 59-month maturity, which was also placed privately, had a base issue size of Rs 500 crore, plus a green shoe option of Rs 1,000 crore. The coupon (also known as yield) was fixed at 7.77 per cent.

Bond market dealers said the big-ticket fundraise had slowed down. Only small-ticket issues are going through. For instance, Varroc Engineering raised Rs 250 crore through a five-year bond at a coupon of 9.2 per cent. Its NCDs carry an “A+” rating from India Ratings.

Sustaining its production pace, CIL produced 52.3 million tonnes (MTs) of coal in August 2023, registering a strong 13.2 per cent increase over 46.2 MTs of August 2022. Its August 2023 production/sales volume continued at the highest-ever level for the fifth successive month in the 2023-24 financial year (FY24). Coal inventory at company’s pitheads stood at a comfortable 45.3 MTs as of 31 August, 46 per cent higher compared to 31 MTs of coal stock at the same time last year. This helps in meeting any sudden demand upsurge from the power sector.
  Going ahead, analysts at ICICI Securities say that the firm is likely to gain from operating leverage benefits, accruing from higher sales volume for both non-regulated sector and e-auction customers, despite much lower e-auction premium than in FY23.
  Meanwhile, based on the demand projection in ‘Vision 2024’ for coal sector in the country and subsequent demand projectionfor Coal India, a roadmap has been prepared to project production plan in medium term wherein the company has envisaged 1 billion tonne coal production by FY26 and beyond to meet the coal demand of the country.

2023-09-07 23:11:00,New rules to attract investment to India's $1.4 bn market: JPMorgan,"By Ishika Mookerjee and Sheryl Tian Tong Lee


India’s new rules for environmental, social and governance investments and ratings are likely to attract more investors to the nation’s $1.4 billion market and serve as a model for other countries, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.
  India is among the first in the world to regulate ESG rating providers and the country’s minimum requirement for funds to invest — according to their stated strategy — is “a high bar,” said Hannah Lee, JPMorgan’s head of ESG equity research for the Asia-Pacific region. “Where India stands out in terms of being trailblazing is probably its level of ambition and some of the thresholds that it has,” she said in an interview.

India rolled out several measures over the past two years to regulate its market for green and other assets, most recently allowing domestic fund managers to launch plans under six types of ESG strategies. The rules are part of a broad campaign to increase oversight. Earlier this year, the country was rocked by a short-seller report alleging poor governance and systemic mismanagement at ports-to-power conglomerate Adani Group.

According to the new rules, at least 80% of total fund assets must be invested in equity and equity-related instruments that align with the stated strategy. It makes India’s the highest benchmark in Asia, Lee said. In Singapore and the Philippines, the threshold is about 67%.

The European Securities and Markets Authority has proposed an 80% threshold for all funds with names that use ESG-linked labels. Europe’s strictest designation for sustainable funds, Article 9 or “dark green,” requires 100% alignment, a high bar that led some asset managers to reclassify their funds under the more lightly restricted category Article 8, or “light green.”

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Oil prices edged down on Thursday as an uncertain outlook for demand from China overshadowed the latest U.S. government weekly report showing strong demand for crude.

U.S. crude oil stockpiles drew down by 6.3 million barrels last week, falling for a fourth consecutive week and down over 6% in the last month, as refineries run at high rates to keep up with global energy demand, Energy Information Administration data showed.
""We're taking a pause in the rally we've been having in West Texas Intermediate,"" said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates. ""The EIA report that just came out is supportive.""

The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond fell by 3 basis points to settle at 7.18 per cent, against 7.21 per cent on Wednesday.

The RBI is in preliminary discussions with a limited group of participants in the bond market to gauge the potential ramifications of enabling the settlement of domestic sovereign bonds through the Euroclear platform.

The potential settlement of domestic currency bonds through an Euroclear-like offshore platform has been a long-standing topic of discussion. Such a development has the potential to streamline the inclusion of Indian bonds in global indices.

“Euroclear in itself is not significant. What is important is that it just makes it easier to access the Indian bond market, and it is a way to bond inclusion, that is what is important,” said Naveen Singh, head of trading & EVP at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership.

“And if bond inclusion happens, there will be a new set of buyers and demand for bonds will increase. The risk associated is that the discussion has been going on for years but it didn't materialise because of something or the other, and there are chances that it might not happen,” Singh said.

Shares of at least nine paper manufacturers rallied 30-50 per cent in the last one month while 11 others climbed 10-30 per cent during the same period on positive sectoral outlook. Analysts said global pulp prices fell quite a bit between January-May and that Indian industry did not make price corrections. They said the new education policy may boost revenue for the sector in the medium term and that ban on single-use plastics also augers well for paper industry. Many paper companies have also seen improvement in balance sheets over last couple of years, they noted.According to IPMA, paper consumption in India will likely reach 30 million tonnes by March 2027. There is growing demand from sectors such as FMCG and retail for innovative packaging solutions as they reduce dependency on plastics. ""Paper stocks can also benefit from the rising e-commerce shopping as well as ready-to-eat and packaged foods,"" Nuvama said in a note.Shares of West Coast Paper Mills climbed 52 per cent to Rs 740 a piece from Rs 486.60 level a month ago. Ruchira Papers climbed 41 per cent during the same period. It was followed by Seshasayee Paper and Boards Ltd (37 per cent),Star Paper Mills Ltd (35 per cent), Astron Paper & Board Mill Ltd (35 per cent) and Tamil Nadu Newsprint & Papers Ltd (33 per cent).Paper companies are also optimistic on future prospects. In its annual report, Tamil Nadu Newsprint said exports of paper and converted paper products may stay robust in future. A strong and robust domestic demand coupled with strategic exports of both paper and converted paper products augers well for the Indian paper industry, it said.""All the major paper companies have entered next phase of expansion due to high-capacity utilisation and strong balance sheet position, which provides good upside potential to the stock from FY26-FY27 perspective. Our pecking in this space is JK Paper followed by West Coast Paper Mills,"" Nuvama said.Nuvama said that since the new curriculum is being developed after a gap of 15 years, it would eliminate sale of second-hand books and would lead to strong growth for at least 2-3 years. Completely replacing second-hand textbooks can be a huge opportunity for paper companies with a higher realisation, it said.Besides, it noted that there is a lot of plastic substitution happening with the single-use plastic ban. The substitution will create an additional 2-3 lakh TPA. Due to the high capital investment required to set up a new packaging board plant, only a few large players, such as ITC Ltd, JK Paper, and West Coast Paper Mills, can capitalise on the opportunity, Nuvama noted.Genus Paper & Boards, Orient Paper & Industries, Andhra Paper, Pudumjee Paper Products Ltd, Malu Paper Mills and Mohit Paper Mills surged 20-30 per cent in the last one month. JK Paper is up 19 per cent in the one month period. Balkrishna Paper Mills and Emami Paper Mills gained 14-15 per cent for the period.Global pulp prices reached a record high level in 2022-23 as the demand increased sharply post Covid period. This was further aggravated by higher energy cost in Europe triggered by Russia-Ukraine war, JK Paper said in its annual report las month.“The low inventory of pulp led to panic buying which also pushed the prices further higher. Consequent to this paper prices also moved up significantly. Opening up of China post Covid restrictions was expected to keep demand buoyant. However, Q4 of 2022-23 witnessed demand slowdown as China buying did not pick up as expected resulting in inventory of pulp producers shooting up from normal levels of 30 days to 60 days. This triggered a price correction in pulp prices and may hit their lowest level in coming months,” JK Paper said last month.""Now with the softening of international demand, the pulp quantities available for the Indian markets from China and Indonesia have considerably increased. Furthermore, international pulp prices have moderated considerably which has aided the drop in prices of finished paper. In this background, we are currently witnessing a surge in imports of woodfree grades in large volumes. This trend is likely to continue. Further, the Indian industry did not make price corrections at the appropriate time, which made the imported woodfree grades attractive for an Indian convertor/market,"" Nuvama said.","Tarab Zaidi,",BusinessToday

2023-09-08 10:16:00,"Adani Ports shares: CLSA maintains buy rating, expects a strong Q2; Check the target price","Shares of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (Adani Ports) continue to hog limelight at Dalal Street as the global brokerage firm CLSA expects Adani Group's blue-chip player to report a strong September 2023 quarter despite slowing global trade, with August 2023 traffic rising 17 per cent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis and up 13 per cent YoY ex-Haifa acquisition.

Ports traffic was led by containers and gasification of cargo mix of traffic, while coal imports picked up following a demand spike, improved viability and a government decree. Its flagship, Mundra Port, saw a resurgence with all-time high traffic in August 2023, led by container and coal traffic on a power demand spike met by improved viability of imported coal, said CLSA.

Adani Group’s flagship Mundra port handled the highest-ever monthly cargo volume in August. The port handled 15.32 MMT of cargo volume in August this year. It also handled 1,776 trains in the same period, which includes 1,532 container trains, according to a company filing on Monday.

Shares of Adani Ports settled marginally higher on Thursday at Rs 809.60, with a total market capitalization of close to Rs 1.75 lakh crore. The scrip has surged more than 105 per cent from its 52-week low at Rs 394.95 hit in February 2023 after the reports from the US-based short seller Hindenburg Research.

Adani Ports operates the Mundra port, which is the largest container handling port in India, having handled more than 6.6 million TEUs in FY23, making it an integral gateway to the north and central parts of the country. In May this year, Adani Group’s Adani Ports handled the highest-ever rail cargo of 120.51 MMT in FY2022-23, surpassing the previous best of 98.61 MMT.

Adani Ports' traffic grew 12 per cent YoY in 1QFY24 led by coal and containers. This was in spite of a 6-day cyclone impact hurting 50 per cent of its capacity and causing a 2 mt loss of traffic. Market share losses in the container market ceased as its terminals in the south regained share.

Its M&A strategy has paid dividends, with Krishnapatnam Port growing volume by 31 per cent YoY, leading its coal volume in Q1FY24. Mundra Port retained its numero uno container port status, and with the opening of a new berth, T3, its capacity should be further enhanced by 800K TEUs by 3QFY24, CLSA added.

The key bright spot was also logistics, with higher bulk volume (up 42 per cent YoY) and rail container traffic up 24 per cent YoY.

2023-09-08 09:20:00,"Cochin Shipyard shares up 36% in 7 days. Kotak says 'Sell' stock, target Rs 990","The stock has been in news as recent comments from the Chief of Naval Staff for a likely placement of a repeat IAC order were encouraging. Indian Navy received the first indigenously-built aircraft carrier (IAC-1) from Cochin Shipyard in July 2022.The Chief of Naval Staff spoke of the manufacturing expertise Cochin Shipyard has acquired through INS 1, limiting the case for the prospect of the repeat order going to another entity, Kotak Institutional Equities said.""In our assessment, what may have changed the stance in favour of the repeat IAC order could be the prospects of one of the two aircraft carriers of India INS Vikramaditya nearing retirement in the next 10-15 years and recent strides made by China in the form of the recent far sea exercise by its indigenous carrier and impending commissioning of its third aircraft carrier,"" it said.Kotak, however, assumes a 10 per cent lower value of the repeat IAC-1 order.""We expect the repeat order of IAC-1 to be smaller than IAC-2, which was earlier planned, and would not have the cost overruns seen in the case of IAC-1 (six-year delay and a six-fold cost overrun). Also, the change in margin norms may further limit the top-line for Cochin Shipyard of the repeat IAC-1 order. The Rs 21,000 crore sum assumed would be equivalent to sub-7 per cent of the naval fleet capex over the next seven years based on our assessment,"" it said.Kotak has revised its fair value for the stock to Rs 990 from Rs 740, as it factors in the potential repeat order at a 10 per cent lower cost than IAC-1 and seven-year execution period.""We downgrade to SELL from BUY, as the CMP is factoring in an additional boost in the form of (1) a larger than Rs230 billion order size and/or (2) incremental IAC order wins/adjacency value. We would aim to consider the adjacency value, once we get more clarity on the same,"" it said.Shares of Cochin Shipyard climbed 20 per cent to close at Rs 1,146.15 on Thursday.Disclaimer: Recommendations provided in this article and/ or any reports attached or relied on herein are authored by an external party.

The company is considering an option to redeem a small portion of the bonds ahead of scheduled payment, partly to lure bondholders to agree to roll over the bonds, ET reported.Vedanta Resources’ high leverage and funding gap of $3 billion in FY2025 are key areas of concern and overhang, Kotak Institutional Equities said this week. It noted that the Vedanta parent has largely addressed the funding gap of FY2024 through various one-time measures, including a 6 per cent stake sale in Vedanta but said the $2.2 billion bonds maturity in FY2025 is a taller hump.""We note that large dividends are no longer possible and Vedanta Resources might be forced to further divest stake/assets in Vedanta. The bleak commodity cycle suggests a downside risk to earnings. We have trimmed earnings and fair value to Rs 200 from Rs 215. Maintain SELL, given the unfavorable risk-reward,"" Kotak said on Vedanta this week.On Friday, the scrip was trading at Rs 238.70 on BSE, down 0.17 per cent.As per the ET report, parent Vedanta Resources has $1 billion 13.875 per cent bonds due in January 2024, $1 billion 6.125 per cent bonds due August 2024 and $1.2 billion 8.95 per cent bonds in March 2025.
